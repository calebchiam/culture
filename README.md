# The Cleanlab Culture

**Our Mission**: automate data-centric ML ops: from data cleaning to training reliable models on real-word, noisy data.

## Our Philosophy
Before Cleanlab, our founders worked at MIT, Harvard, Stanford, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Amazon Alexa, AWS, Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Dropbox, Oculus Research, Palantir, NASA, General Electric, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and a few other places. We kept our eyes open. We paid attention to what worked and what did not. We observed how Amazon prioritizes the customer, Google prioritizes the technology, and Facebook prioritizes the employee.

At Cleanlab, we strive to combine the good and avoid the bad from what we have learned working in the world's top technology and AI organizations in order to build a company culture that **cares**: about our customers, our impact on the world, and each other.

Behind the Cleanlab product and mission is a team of unique (and incredibly talented) creators -- it is the people and their collective culture that comprise our company and ultimately define the role that Cleanlab will play in creating value for humanity and for our world.

## Our Guiding principles
These principles define how we **ACT**: **A**ct, **T**hink, and **C**reate.

### How we treat each other
#### 1. Care
* About your work, about your co-workers, and about yourself. Don't stand by while a teammate struggles.

#### 2. Be Empathetic
* EQ is as important, if not more important, than IQ. Importantly, EQ includes self-empathy.

#### 3. Be Helpful
* Our best work comes when we work together effectively. We succeed only if we help each other succeed.
* 
#### 4. Have Courageous Conversations
* Be brave. Give each other honest feedback when there is a problem. These conversations diversify thinking and enhance empathy.

### How we tackle problems

#### 5. Own Your Work
* We own our problems and solutions. We take pride in the work that we do.

#### 6. Have Substance
* Make claims and have strong opinions, but back them up with strong evidence.

#### 7. Question
* Don't go straight for the answer. The art of success is in asking good questions. A well-posed question may unveil a simpler solution.

### How we stay grounded

#### 8. Be Humble
* Arrogance is blinding. Humility is key to solving problems with unexpected solutions.

#### 9. Be Responsible
* Individually and as an organization. To the world and to ourselves.

#### 10. Find Humor
* We're here to work hard, but not to take ourselves too seriously. Our best solutions come from playfulness, not from pressure.
